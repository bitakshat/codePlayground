## Problem
Bob's crush's name starts with a vowel. That's the reason Bob loves vowels too much. He calls a string "lovely string" if it contains either all the lowercase vowels or all the uppercase vowels or both, else he calls that string "ugly string". 

## Output
For each test case, print "lovely string" or "ugly string"  (without quotes)  according to the definition of Bob.

## Constraints
string contains only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. 
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= len(S) <= 100000
