### Seven Segment Display
Alice got a number writted in **seven segment** where each segment was creatted used a matchstick
Example: If Alice gets a number 123 so basically Alice used 12 matchsticks for this number.<br/>

Alice is wondering what is the numerically largest value that she can generate by using at most the matchsticks that she current possess. Help Alice out by telling her the number.<br/>

###### Input Format
First line contains **T** (test cases).<br/>
Next **T** lines contain a Number **N**.
###### Output Format
Print the **largest** possible number **numerically** that can be generated using **at max** that namy number of matchsticks which was used to generate *N*.

###### Constraionts:
<code>1 <= T <= 100</code><br/>
<code>1 <= length(N) <= 100</code>
