## Problem

You are given a number N. You can perform the following operations on N any number of times:<br>

> If N is even, divide N by 2.<br>
> If N is odd, replace N with 3N+1.<br>

Your task is to find out, for a given N, if it is possible to reach the number 1 after performing the above two valid operations on N any number of times.

###### Input

- First-line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- Next T lines contain just one integer, N.

###### Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to reach 1 for the given N. Else print "NO"(without quotes).

###### Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100 <br>
2 <= N <= 10<code><sup>100,000</sup></code> <br>
