## Problem
There are three integers k,m,n. You have to convert the number k to m by performing the given operations:<br/>
- Multiply k by n
- Decrease k by 2
- Decrease k by 1

You have to perform the above operations to convert the integer from k to m and find the minimum steps.<br/>
> Note: You can perform operations in any order
## Input
First-line contains the number of test cases T.<br/>
The next T line contains three space-separated integers k, m and n<br/>
## Output
Print minimum number of steps as output in a new line for each test case.
##Constraints
1 <= T <= 10^4
0 <= k,m,n <=10^9

## Compilation and execution
Use `g++ minimumsteps.cc -o minimumsteps --std=c++14` to compile<br/>
and `./minimumsteps < testcase.txt` to execute
